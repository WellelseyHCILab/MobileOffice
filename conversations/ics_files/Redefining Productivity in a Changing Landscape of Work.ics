DESCRIPTION:When: Thursday\, April 16\, 8 AM PST (11 AM EST\, 17:00 Cent
 ral European time)\n\nWhere: Zoom Meeting\n\nPassword: ""\n\nSpeaker: Sh
 amsi Iqbal\n\nAbstract: Research in the area of productivity and multita
 sking has to adapt to the changing world anticipating what the future ma
 y look like - in particular taking into account growing needs of balanci
 ng work and life. The natural direction that work was taking only a few 
 weeks ago has been challenged in recent times\, and established norms an
 d practices are adapting as a results. Are these changes for the better?
  Are we gaining a much more realistic view of what true balance of work 
 and life may look like?\n\nMy research has focused on redefining product
 ivity where doing work is no longer confined to being at a desk and the 
 need to do things while on the go and in divided attention situations co
 ntinues to dominate. Artificial intelligence is also fundamentally chall
 enging what we envision as the future of work. Because now we can have m
 achine intelligence supplement human intelligence - people can be empowe
 red to attempt and achieve beyond what was once thought possible. Howeve
 r\, to blend in the needs of emotional and physical well-being\, we need
  to look at this challenge using a human-centric approach. This work bri
 ngs together theories from cognitive science\, human computer interactio
 n and artificial intelligence. I will discuss a few ongoing projects in 
 this area and present directions for research and product development.\n
