              Advances in computing technology are rapidly changing the way we work. Human-computer interaction is a critical aspect of this ongoing change. The reason for this is that workers need advanced HCI to successfully interact with emerging computing devices. In this series of conversations, we are asking experts with various backgrounds to help us understand how advanced HCI will support work in the future and how it will also allow workers to balance productivity with wellbeing. While we are primarily interested in how HCI can support new ways to work, technological solutions are always embedded in societal structures. For this reason, we will strive to understand the future of work as a relationship between technology and society.

              In the near term, our conversations will explore the effects of the COVID-19 crisis on work through the prism of HCI. The COVID-19 crisis resulted in a sudden and dramatic change in how we work. For many of us, the well-known mainstays of work are gone, or drastically different than they were before - this includes the eight-hour workday, the office building, the morning commute, in-person conversations with coworkers, as well as sending children to school or daycare. How can HCI support worker productivity, as well as worker wellbeing, under these new circumstances? Furthermore, how do these new circumstances provide a window into the future of work?
            </p>
              <p align="justify">The HCI community has a central role to play in creating the future of work. We invite you to join our conversations with leading experts about how we can best do this.

      <p><b>Speaker: </b>Shamsi Iqbal</p>

      <p align="justify"> <b>Abstract: </b>Research in the area of productivity and multitasking has to adapt to the changing world anticipating what the future may look like - in particular taking into account growing needs of balancing work and life. The natural direction that work was taking only a few weeks ago has been challenged in recent times, and established norms and practices are adapting as a results. Are these changes for the better? Are we gaining a much more realistic view of what true balance of work and life may look like?</p>

      <p align="justify">My research has focused on redefining productivity where doing work is no longer confined to being at a desk and the need to do things while on the go and in divided attention situations continues to dominate. Artificial intelligence is also fundamentally challenging what we envision as the future of work. Because now we can have machine intelligence supplement human intelligence - people can be empowered to attempt and achieve beyond what was once thought possible. However, to blend in the needs of emotional and physical well-being, we need to look at this challenge using a human-centric approach. This work brings together theories from cognitive science, human computer interaction and artificial intelligence. I will discuss a few ongoing projects in this area and present directions for research and product development.</p>

      <p align="justify"><b>Bio: </b>Dr. Shamsi T. Iqbal is a Principal Researcher in the Information and Data Sciences (IDEAS) group in Microsoft Research, AI. Her primary expertise is in the domain of Attention Management and Interruptions. More recently her work has focused on redefining productivity, introducing novel ways of being productive and balancing productivity and well-being in interaction design. Her work on driving and distraction has been featured in the New York Times, MIT Tech Review among others, and also featured in the King 5 News (NBC affiliate in the Seattle area). Shamsi has served on many organizing and program committees for HCI conferences, is currently serving as an ACM TOCHI Associate Editor and will be serving as the General Co-Chair for UIST 2020. She received her Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2008 and Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology in 2001.</p>
